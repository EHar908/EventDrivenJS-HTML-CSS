Purpose
------------
This application allows you to create a recipe, including what ingredients and instructions are needed.

Function
------------
You may navigate between the different boxes with either your mouse or the TAB key. 

Once you type in either an ingredient or instruction, you may press Enter immediately, navigate to the ADD button and press Enter, or hover your cursor over the ADD button and click on it. 

When you do so, a blue bubble containing the ingredient or instruction will appear in the respective ingredient/instruction box. 

You may navigate to these ingredient/instruction bubbles with TAB, as well. 

If you want to remove any of these, you simply navigate to the bubble and press Enter OR hover your cursor over them and click on them. 

If you'd rather get rid of all of them, simply navigate to the bottom and click on "Reset." 

Once you have a recipe you're happy with, simply navigate or click on the "Save Recipe Card" button. 

This will create and save an HTML file for you. Upon opening, it will present your recipe in a browser formatted nicely on a card.

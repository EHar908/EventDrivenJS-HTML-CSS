                    <p>I worked as a consultant in regards to strengthening the popularity of the WoC IP. In fact, 
                        and keep this between us, I'm the one that suggested the new OGL change! Yeah! That was me! I think once we 
                        roll it out early 2023, things will really start looking up for Wizards of the Coast.

                    <p>I and a small team worked to translate the mad teachings of Sheogorath into the Oblivion game. It wasn't easy, 
                        travelling between Texas and the Shivering Isles was a lot on the old noggin. 
                        That said, I also helped with Sheogorath's premire albume, ZOOM, available now on YouTube. 
                        (Look it up, it's pretty good)

                    <div>201-203 (4th Era)</div>
                    <p>I was brought into Whiterun for a couple of years to address some of the tension bewteen the denizens. For instance, 
                        every single patient I spoke with shared the same experience of a farmer saying, and I quote, 
                        "Do you get to the Cloud District very often? Oh what am I saying, of course you don't."
                        While I was able to help most of my patients, Nazeem and the guards didn't take too kindly and drove me out of town.

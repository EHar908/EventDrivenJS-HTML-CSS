# EventDrivenJS-HTML-CSS
Purpose
------------
Projects that practice and develop event-driven programming using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

How to run/access
------------
You can simply download these files and select the HTML file in its folder. This will also automatically launch the application in your default browser. 

Alternatively, if you're running these in Visual Studio Code, it's recommended that you search and download the 'open in browser' extension. 
This allows you to then right-click on the index.html file and select 'Open in default browser' for a given application. 
As it sounds, this will then launch the application in your browser.
